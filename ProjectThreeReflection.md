I thought this project wasn't too hard. The paper prototyping was pretty fun because I could draw out the different ways the application could look like. However, attempting to create the application on the nocode platform was hard. My group chose AppSheet to build our application on, but I realised there is slightly a lack of flexibility when trying to create your own app on there. It's hard to figure out how to display the information the way you want it to and there is limited flexibility in how you start to build the app. For example, on AppSheet, you can either build the app by using one of the sample apps they offer, or start by importing your own data. Both of those options make it hard to build the app because if we chose the option of building our app through a sample app, we have to end uo deleting a lot of the features the sample app has, which is time consuming. On the other hand, choosing to build our app through starting with importing data is hard because we still are trying to figure out the exact things/data that needs to be part of this application. Overall, this project wasn't too hard and did not take too much time. However, I know it will be time-consuming if we have to properly create the app on the nocode platform.
