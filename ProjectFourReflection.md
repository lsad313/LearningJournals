The most challegnging part of this project was desigining the application and trying to get all the functions working. Particularly trying to implement a proper messaging feature was quite hard. When I went through sample apps that had a messaging feature, the user could only respond to the message by emailing the sender of the message, rather than replying to them directly on the app. It seems like this is one of the weaknesses of creating an application on AppSheets. AppSheets doesn't allow users to stay on the app when a certain action is completed. For example, if external links or sources are added to the application, it will redirect the user to a new tab, rather than allowing them to stay on the app. This negatively impacts the UX, as I don't think a user would want to be redirected to a new tab everytime they click on a resource. Completing this project makes me want to study more about UI and UX, as I did not realise how everything in creating an app is centred around UI/UX. If this course is still available next semester/upcoming year, it would be cool if a module on UI/UX is added, espeically if the project is based on creating an application again. Overall, this project was slightly time-consuming, as there was a lot to think about in how to strucutre the application and checking to see if each feature works.
