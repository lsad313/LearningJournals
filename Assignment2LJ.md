I found this assignment extremely difficult because I have never worked with Python, or any other programming language before. Furthermore, since this course does not focus on a specific language, I do not have a proper foundation for any of the languages. As such, I had to spend a lot of my time going through multiple resources and YouTube videos to find some guidance. However, towards the end, I still found it quite hard so I had to get a friend to help guide me through the assignment. I started this assignment after the lab last week, so I spent all week on it. However, the majority of the time was spent looking through resources to help me. I realiesd that I find it really difficult to write code by myself. I alwyays need to see an example while writing the code or have someone help me write it. As such I found this assignment hard and also the midterm test. From this, I realised i need to study how to write code by myself without looking at example codes or having someone else guide me. However, I find this difficult to do because wthis course does not focus on a specific programming language, so I'm not really sure how to go about studying practically for this course.
