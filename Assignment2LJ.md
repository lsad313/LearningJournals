Assignment 2:
I have just started Assignment 2, and it seems like it will take quite a while for me to complete. I am not confident in my code writing skills and I find it hard to come up with code myself. I think for this assignment, I will have to look up various websites to help me complete this assignment. For this assignment, I have been assigned to use Python for my programming language. I spoke to a friend and they said Python is okay to solve this problem and that I was lucky I did not get Javascript, since apparently that programming language is hard to write for this problem. Since this assignment is due next Monday, I will try to make progress on this assignment by Thursday night.
