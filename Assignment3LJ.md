The hardest part of thsi assignment was finding a resource that shows how to programmatically access AWS Services. I spent a large part of my time going through many resources trying to find a source that shows how to programmatically access AWS Services and authenticate the user's account. I think a reason why it was hard to find a resource for this was becasue AWS already has many different ways in which a user can authenticate their account without having to use Javascript or Python. Aside from that, the assignment was relatively okay. I just spent so much time trying to find a resource for the questions. Additionally, it took a lot of time for me to find a resource I could understand becasue I found that many resources I looked at had so much jargon that I was unable to understand. 
The coding part of the assignment was doable because I followed the example that was done in class, which helped (under module 7.7). From this assignment, I still want to study APIs a little more and make sure I can really do the coding portion of it if it shows up on the final exam.
