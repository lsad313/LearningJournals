I quite liked this project because it allowed me to play around with the creation of an app without having to code anything. I have always thought making an app would be extremely hard, which I am sure it is, but nocode platforms such as AppSheet and PowerApps allow inexperienced users like myself to still learn about app creation. I think these nocode platforms would be very useful when making a prototype for an app, or if you just want to play around with some ideas. Furthermore, playing around with these platforms made me realise how much app builders have to think about when trying to make their app user-friendly. Someone could have the greatest idea for an app in the world, but if it's not easy for a user to use, or looks pleasing, then no one would use it. Currently, I want to learn more about UI and UX design, so exploring the UX feature on AppSheet was cool since it gives you many features on what your app could look like and how data could be presented. Having these options are useful because then you can learn yourself what looks the best and what is easiest to navigate. 

This project did not take too long to complete, but I did not spend too much time creating my AppSheet app since I had other assignments to complete. However, I definitely would like to explore it more after all my other work is done, especially since later on we will be building our own app based on the app idea we have created.
